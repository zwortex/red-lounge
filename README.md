# Murmurs of Red (red-lounge)

## A collection of red mezzanines and other scripts

Sometimes, you wish there was available in Red a particular function that is missing, or when the function exists, that it would behave slightly differently than it currently does. 

Like any good craftsman, make your own tool : one that is spot on and eases the task at hand. This repository gathers such mezzanine functions and scripts, as long as they are generic enough to be useful in various situations.
